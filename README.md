# Hybrid Search
**Hybrid Search** in the realm of vector databases refers to the combination of **semantic search** (based on vector similarity) and **traditional keyword-based search** to deliver more precise and relevant results. This approach leverages the strengths of both methods to handle complex queries effectively.

## Key Components

### 1. **Semantic Search (Vector Similarity)**
   - Utilizes embeddings (dense vectors) generated by machine learning models.
   - Measures the **cosine similarity**, **dot product**, or other distance metrics between vectors.
   - Ideal for capturing the meaning and context of text, images, or other types of data.
   - Example: Finding documents with similar themes or content, even if exact keywords differ.

### 2. **Keyword-Based Search**
   - Relies on traditional inverted indexing.
   - Matches exact or fuzzy keywords in the data.
   - Effective for precise queries or structured data retrieval.
   - Example: Finding documents containing the exact phrase "machine learning."

## Why Use Hybrid Search?

- **Combining Precision and Context:** Semantic search provides contextual understanding, while keyword search ensures exact matches when needed.
- **Handling Diverse Queries:** Supports both natural language queries (e.g., "What is blockchain?") and specific keyword-based searches (e.g., "blockchain development tutorial").
- **Optimized for Different Data Types:** Works seamlessly with unstructured (e.g., text embeddings) and structured data (e.g., metadata or tags).

## How It Works

1. **Query Processing:**
   - A query is split into two components:
     - A **semantic vector representation**.
     - Keywords or exact phrases.
2. **Search Execution:**
   - Perform a vector similarity search in the database.
   - Simultaneously execute a keyword search using an inverted index.
3. **Result Fusion:**
   - Combine results from both searches using a scoring algorithm.
   - Adjust weights based on the importance of semantic relevance vs. keyword match.
4. **Ranked Output:**
   - Return a list of results ranked by relevance.

## Use Cases

- **E-Commerce:** Combine product descriptions (semantic search) with user-specified filters like price or brand (keyword search).
- **Document Retrieval:** Retrieve documents relevant to a concept while ensuring certain keywords are included.
- **Question-Answering Systems:** Find answers where both context and specific terms matter.

## Example Workflow

1. **Query:** "Find articles about deep learning frameworks released in 2023."
2. **Hybrid Search Breakdown:**
   - Semantic Search: Use the query to find articles related to "deep learning frameworks."
   - Keyword Search: Look for articles containing "2023."
3. **Result Fusion:** Combine and rank results, showing the most contextually and temporally relevant articles at the top.

## Popular Vector Databases Supporting Hybrid Search

- **Pinecone**
- **Weaviate**
- **Milvus**
- **Qdrant**

By blending the best of both worlds, hybrid search enhances accuracy, relevance, and versatility in search systems.

- In this repository, We have used pinecone for vector based search and for keyword based search.
- Documents are retrieved from the PDF "RL.pdf" and they are added to the database
- When the user queries the database, it responds automatically, using both the keyword based search and the semantic search.
